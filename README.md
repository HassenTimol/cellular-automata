# Cellular automata

This project implements four cellular automata and allows the user to visualise them in an interactive way.

It includes John Conway's 'Game Of Life', which you can learn more about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

It also includes the well-known one-dimensional 'Elementary cellular automaton', which you can learn more about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton


It finally includes two less-known cellular automata, one of them simulates the propagation of an epidemic within a population and the other one simulates the evolution of road traffic.

Note that the cellular-automaton designed to study road traffic is heavily inspired from the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model, which you can learn more about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagel%E2%80%93Schreckenberg_model

## Getting Started

To clone the program on your local computer you can run 
```
'git clone https://github.com/automatescellulaires2019/cellular-automata.git'
```
into the command line / terminal of your machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need p5.js to run 2 of the 4 cellular automata properly.
p5.js will come automatically if you clone the repository on your local machine.

You can also download p5.js from here: https://p5js.org/download/

Or use p5.js's online web editor: https://editor.p5js.org/

## Authors

This project has been realised by Hassen TIMOL and Takanori CODRON-AKIEDA as part of the 2019 Mauritius Science Quest.
